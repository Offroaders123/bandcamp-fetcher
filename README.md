# bandcamp-fetcher

Just a neat little tool I made to solve some needs I had to get metadata about my own Bandcamp page, both for archiving and documenting purposes.

This project isn't actually complete yet, note that this is the goal for it though. I plan to copy over what I wrote about each project to my personal site, and I'd rather programatically copy it over, and add it to verson control incrementally, rather than copy it manually, and possibly make mistakes because of human error, or other fluke things.

Listening to Nonkertompf, definitely recommend it, love it as coding mood music!
